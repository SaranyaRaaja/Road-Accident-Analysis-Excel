I created a road accident dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that the clients can have insights on the below requirements.

-Primary KPIs

.Total casualties taken place after the accident.

.Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.

.Total casualties with respect to vehicle type.

-Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year.

-Maximum casualties by road type.

-Distribution of total casualties by road surface.

-Relation between casualties by location and by day/night.
